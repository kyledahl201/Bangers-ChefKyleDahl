					<h1>Personal Profile</h1>
				</div>
				
				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p>First off, I just want to start out by saying that I am the chef you want to pick up this sword with and cut off the dragon’s head.  I am so confident that with my problem solving skills and adaptability combined with a raw culinary talent and leadership ability, we won’t just walk this post-COVID road together, but completely and utterly conquer it.</p>
				
					<p> My name is Kyle and I am an experienced chef from Minnesota. With over 15 combined years in the food service industry, I have spent over half my life working with the things I love most, food and people.  I have worked almost every conceivable job in this business, from drive-thru attendant, to dishwasher, from line cook to the executive chef of multiple high-profile restaurants in a major North American city. I’ve seen and done it all.  In December of 2019, I left an exploding chef career behind in Minneapolis.  With everything I had,  a big dream, and a food truck, I moved to Austin and fell in love with this city immediately. Unfortunately, right as the COVID crises began, we were completely crushed, and my business partner was forced to bring the truck back to Minnesota. Unsure of my future and wanting to better myself in a turbulent time, I found a full-stack computer programming bootcamp program at the University of Texas at Austin, and I immediately fell in love with that too. The natural and logical structure of writing code was beautiful to me. Now that I have graduated and the economy is re-opening, I am eager to return to food service to apply my problem-solving skills to a help shape a completely new arena post COVID-19.</p>
					
					<p>I wanted to make this web page specifically for your team at Banger’s to show you just how far I will go to prove to you that I am your guy.  You aren’t just looking for a chef.  I understand that.  To be perfectly honest, there are thousands of chefs out there with a ton of raw culinary talent, with incredible knife skills, and plenty of expertise to run the type of menu you are looking to serve at Banger’s.  I am not one of them.  I want to offer you so much more in a leader.  This job has called out to me on a higher level because I feel that your expectations of leadership and culture are just so similar to my own vision.  I am completely committed to the teams that I am on.  It is so much more than a job to me, or a career path even.  It is a lifestyle based in honesty, empathy, and compassion, constantly putting your team about yourself.  Leading with a purpose. Truly being a player/coach that doesn’t just dictate, but leads by example. The qualities you speak of in your job posting just ring so true to me.  I have the experience you are looking for, and certainly the culinary and technical skills, but we can do so much more together.  I sincerely want to join your team to be apart of something bigger than myself, to problem solve our way out of an unprecedented time in not just food service but the world at large.</p>
					
					<p>That brings us to the conversation about compensation.  I completely get it, and I am open to working something out that is also unprecedented in our industry.  I fully expect to not be taking home anything close to what I was earning in salary at my last posting as an executive, and I am okay with that.  It is so much more important to me to join something bigger, something important, a team all of us believe can do something amazing in this new food universe we find ourselves in.  I completely agree that Banger’s is uniquely positioned to rocket out of these dark days we have been in, and I so want to be apart of the team that not just gets by in a post COVID world, but explodes forward.   This isn’t about just getting a job I need to get by or make money even, this is about joining something I truly believe in, and I cannot stress that enough.</p>
					
					<p>Please understand that I am presenting myself as honestly as I possibly can.  I am not bullshitting you at all, nor would I ever.  If we begin a relationship together, I would only ever be completely honest and forthcoming with you.  As if we are family, because I am in this for the long haul for you.  If we decide to work together, I want you to know that I am here to see this through with you, and truly find a home.  I only write so strongly at times because I don’t just think I am the right candidate for you, but I know I am the guy you want to help move Banger’s forward.  I look forward to speaking with you and your team soon, and in the mean time I wish everyone at Banger’s the best, for I know this hasn’t been easy for anyone.</p>
					
					<p>Always onward and upward, </p>
